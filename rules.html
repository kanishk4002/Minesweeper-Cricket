        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        
        The objective of the game is to score a certain number of runs before reaching the score limit or clicking on a block that contains a fielder.
        
        <h3>Game Setup:</h3>
        
        Select the grid size (6x6 or 7x7) and the difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Tough).
        The game board is displayed as a grid of blocks.
        Fielder blocks are randomly placed on the game board.
        NoBall blocks are randomly placed on the game board.
        The player starts with a score of 0.
        
        <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
        
        Click on a block to reveal its content.
        If the clicked block contains a fielder, the game ends or the number of Free-Hits reduces by one depending on the number of lives at that time.
        if the clicked block contains a NoBall, the number of Free-Hits increases by one.
        If the clicked block contains a run value (1, 2, 4, 6), the score is increased by the corresponding value.
        The player's score is displayed on the scorecard.
        Remaining number of Free-Hits allowed is displayed on the scorecard.
        
        <h3>Scoring:</h3>
        
        Each run value (1, 2, 4, 6) represents the number of runs scored by the player.
        The player's score is incremented by the run value when a block with a run value is clicked.
        
        
        <h3>Win Condition:</h3>
        
        The player wins the game if their score reaches or exceeds the score limit defined by the selected difficulty level.

        <h3>Lose Condition:</h3>
        
        The player loses the game if the remaining number of Free-Hits is 0 and they click on a block that contains a fielder.
        A game over message is displayed when the game is lost.
        
        <h3>Restarting the Game:</h3>
        
        After a game ends (either win or lose), the player can click the "Start Game" button to reset the game and play again.
        At any point during the game, the player can click the "Start Game" button to reset the game and start from the beginning.
